# Description
This is a studying project from Codam Core Curriculum and is all about writing one's own HTTP server.
It requires understanding some basic networking stuff (socket management, binding), good understanding of I/O streams and plug-in architecture to add CGI.

## Requirements: 
- HTTP server must be written in C++ 98. :unamused:
- The program has to take a configuration file as argument, or use a default path.
- The server must never block and the client can be bounced properly if necessary.
- It must be non-blocking.
- A request to the server should never hang forever.
- The server must be compatible with the web browser of your choice.
- You server must have default error pages if none are provided.
- You can’t use fork for something else than CGI (like PHP, or Python, and so forth).
- You must be able to serve a fully static website.
- Clients must be able to upload files.
- You need at least GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
- Your server must be able to listen to multiple ports.

***Kqueue*** system call is used for I/O Multiplexing. 

# How to run the program

This will start the webserver with the default configuration.
